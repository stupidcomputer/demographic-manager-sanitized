# demographic-manager-sanitized

The software in this repo is crappily cobbled together to generate Excel files with final reports for demographic information.

This repo does not contain actual demographic information -- there's an original called `demographic-manager` that does.
That information has been removed via rewriting git history, so that's why it looks weird
